# Advancing Agricultural Weather Predictions with Deep Learning and Machine Learning Approaches: A Study of Short-Term and Long-Term Models 


  The goal of this project was to predict maximum temperature and precipitation using both short-term and long-term approaches, helping to improve decision-making in the agricultural sector.
ðŸ“Œ Implemented Models:

ðŸ•’ Short-Term Forecasting:
 â€¢ Linear Regression
 â€¢ Support Vector Regression (SVR)
 â€¢ Random Forest
 â€¢ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
 
âœ… Results:

 â€¢ MAE = 0.02 for Random Forest (Max Temperature)
 â€¢ MAE = 0.02 for CNN (Precipitation)
ðŸ“† Long-Term Forecasting:

 â€¢ ARIMAX Model
 â€¢ MAE = 0.05 for Max Temperature
 â€¢ MAE = 0.08 for Precipitation
 
Throughout the project, I independently handled all stages, including data preprocessing, outlier detection, feature engineering, model implementation, and performance evaluation.
